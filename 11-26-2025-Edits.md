## Top 10 Countries Race

- **Before:** The racing bar chart showed an empty plot until the user pressed **Start Race** or manually dragged the year slider, and the play button could become unreliable due to internal state issues and a scoping bug.
- **After:** The chart now renders a **default set of top-10 bars** for the current slider year as soon as the page loads, and the play/pause behavior has been refactored so the slider, metric dropdown, and start button all stay in sync and reliably restart or pause the race.

## Narrative & Key Takeaway

- **Before:** The page described “global transformation” in general terms, but the visualizations were not anchored to a single guiding question or explicit takeaway about what viewers should learn.
- **After:** The hero section, visualization descriptions, and writeup now center on the question **“Have poorer countries caught up with richer ones in health, even if they remain far behind in income?”**, emphasizing the contrast between persistent wealth inequality and surprising convergence in life expectancy across countries.

## Plot-Level Narrative Text

- **Before:** Each visualization had a short generic description, but there was little on-page guidance about how individual plots answer the guiding question or fit together into a single story.
- **After:** Added per-plot captions under the map, racing bar chart, stream graph, bubble chart, radar chart, and trajectory chart that explicitly explain how each view supports the theme of **health convergence versus wealth inequality** and how readers should use the interactions to see that contrast.

## Bubble Chart Year Range & India/China Focus

- **Before:** The Wealth, Health & Population bubble chart’s year slider mapping assumed fixed 10-year steps starting in 1960, which could cause the animation and slider to behave oddly if the underlying data years were irregular, making it appear as if the chart “stopped” updating after the mid-1960s.
- **After:** The bubble chart now derives and sorts the actual available `healthData` years, snaps the slider to the closest real year, and initializes the range and labels from the data so the plot can smoothly explore the full temporal extent of the dataset.
- **New:** Added an India & China focused trajectory chart that isolates their GDP-per-capita vs life-expectancy paths, with narrative text emphasizing how large, early gains in life expectancy appear to precede and accompany later income growth in these two population giants.

## Journey Through Time – Wealth & Health Together

- **Before:** The scrollytelling “Journey Through Time” line chart plotted regional total GDP only, so wealth dominated the story and there was no direct view of how global health (life expectancy) evolved alongside it.
- **After:** The timeline now shows **regional GDP per capita** (wealth) for each region over time on the left axis and overlays two dashed **population-weighted life expectancy** lines (one for “Western” regions: North America & Europe, and one for the rest of the world) on a right axis, so as you scroll you can see both the persistence of income gaps and the narrowing gap in health between rich and poorer regions.
